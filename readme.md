# Introduction
This handbook is a central collection point for various bits of knowledge that should be useful to new starters in the Barnardo's Digital team. It outlines our core values, how we got here in the first place, what our aims and objectives are, as well as more practical points about how to get the printers to work, where to get a cup of coffee, or how to connect to various systems and networks. It also outlines principles about how we work (and why) with code, design and research.

The handbook is a living document, not immutable law. It is meant to change and get better over time as we figure more things out. Contributions from team members are welcome, just [submit a PR](contributing.md)
