# Meetings 

In order to make life better for remote folks, follow the following golden rules:

- Start the meeting on time. Hanging on waiting for someone to initiate a hangout / appear.in is much more painful than waiting in the space where the meeting takes place.
- Make sure the audio and video is working correctly. In the meeting room this means using a dedicated microphone. For individuals dialling in it means wearing a headset with a microphone in order to cut out ambient noise.
- Mute yourself when you're just listening.
